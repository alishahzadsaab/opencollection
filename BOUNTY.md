# Bounty

This repository is part of the Open Collective bounty program. Get paid to contribute to Open Source!

## Intro

The Open Collective engineering team is small and we're always looking for new contributors to our Open Source codebases. Our Bounty program is an opportunity to solve issues that could be neglected otherwise. Contributors who fix these issues will be rewarded financially.

## How it works

Based on the importance of the issue and its complexity, we attach a bounty between $100 and $1000 to the ticket.

For reference, until July 2020, we used the following model but we moved to the more flexible one:

- \$100: minimal or unknown complexity
- \$200: simple complexity
- \$500: medium complexity

We want to attract quality contributions. The issue will only be considered complete and approved for payment if the Pull Request is merged by an Open Collective [Core Developer](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/team).

### Workflow for Bounty Program Contributors

1. Search for issues with attached bounties:

   - [Bounties for all repositories](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abounty)

2. Express interest by commenting on the issue and ask to be assigned

3. Open a Pull Request and ask for feedback and review

4. Incorporate feedback from [Core Developers](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/team), if applicable

5. PR is reviewed, approved, and merged by a [Core Developer](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/team)

6. Get paid:
   - If you can issue an invoice, submit it as expense to [Open Collective Engineering](https://opencollective.com/engineering)
   - If you can't issue an invoice, ask to be rewarded with an Open Collective Gift Card
