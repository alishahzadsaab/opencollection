Bio
---

I'm almost 40 years old, french and originally from [Caen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caen). Growing up, I spent around 10 years in the Paris area.

I currently live in [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) with my wife Julie and my 2 daughters: Chloé (11 years old) and Léonie (7 years old).

Before joining Open Collective, I worked for [Upian](https://www.upian.com/), [Netvibes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netvibes), [EyeEm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeEm) and founded [Access Watch](https://access.watch).

Schedule
--------

Based in Berlin, I'm in the [CET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time) timezone.

We're currently in pandemic time and "lockdown", so I currently have a different schedule than usual.

I start my days between 9h and 10h and normally finish at 18h the latest.

Open Source
-----------

I created [Hyperwatch](https://github.com/hyperwatch/hyperwatch) to help technical people analyze web traffic to their websites and APIs.

I [contributed](https://github.com/depcheck/depcheck/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aznarf+is%3Aclosed) to [depcheck](https://github.com/depcheck/depcheck) to help people better track their npm dependencies.
