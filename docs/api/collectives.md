# Collectives API

## Get info

Get detailed information about a collective:

`/:collectiveSlug.:format(json|csv)`

E.g.: https://opencollective.com/webpack.json

```json
{
  "slug": "webpack",
  "currency": "USD",
  "image": "https://cl.ly/221T14472V23/icon-big_x6ot1e.png",
  "balance": 7614777,
  "yearlyIncome": 28499262,
  "backersCount": 556,
  "contributorsCount": 1098
}
```

Notes:

- `image` is the logo of the collective
- all amounts are in the smaller unit of the currency (cents)
- `backersCount` includes both individual backers and organizations (sponsors)
- `yearlyIncome` is the projection of the annual budget based on previous donations and monthly pledges

## Get members

Returns all members of the collectives (core contributors, contributors, backers, sponsors)

`/:collectiveSlug/members.:format(json|csv)`

You can also filter by member type (`USER` or `ORGANIZATION`):

`/:collectiveSlug/members/:memberType(all|users|organizations).:format(json|csv)`

E.g.
- https://opencollective.com/webpack/members.json?limit=10&offset=0
- https://opencollective.com/webpack/members/all.json?limit=10&offset=0

```json
[
  {
    "MemberId": 8198,
    "createdAt": "2017-10-25 09:52",
    "type": "USER",
    "role": "BACKER",
    "tier": "Backer",
    "isActive": true,
    "totalAmountDonated": 1000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "lastTransactionAt": "2018-02-01 10:53",
    "lastTransactionAmount": 200,
    "profile": "https://opencollective.com/ralph03",
    "name": "Ralph03",
    "company": null,
    "description": "",
    "image": "https://opencollective-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/882e5a00-ce64-11e7-ae39-cb1f4eb45be3.jpg",
    "email": null,
    "twitter": null,
    "github": "https://github.com/kazup01",
    "website": null
  },
  ...
]
```

Parameters:

- limit: number of members to return per call
- offset: number of members to skip (for pagination)

Notes:
- `github` is verified via oauth but `twitter` is not
- `email` returns null unless you make an authenticated call using the `accessToken` of one of the admins of the collective
- all amounts are in the smaller unit of the currency (cents)
- `type` can be `USER`, `ORGANIZATION` or `COLLECTIVE`
- `role` can be `ADMIN`, `MEMBER`, `BACKER`, `ATTENDEE`, `FOLLOWER`, `FUNDRAISER`
- `tier` is the name of the tier
- `isActive` specifies if the backer has an active subscription

## Get members per tier

`/:collectiveSlug/[all|users|organizations].:format(json|csv)?TierId=:TierId`

You can find the `TierId` by looking at the URL after clicking on a Tier Card on the collective page (e.g. `TierId` for https://opencollective.com/webpack/order/266 is `266`).

Alternatively, you can also use the slug of a tier:

`/:collectiveSlug/tiers/:tierSlug/[all|users|organizations].format(json|csv)`

E.g. 
- https://opencollective.com/babel/members/all.json?TierId=1906&limit=10&offset=0
- https://opencollective.com/babel/tiers/gold-sponsors/all.json?limit=10&offset=0

```json
