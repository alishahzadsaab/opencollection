# Architecture

In our codebase, a collective is a `Group`. A group has multiple users with separate roles: `HOST`, `MEMBER` and `BACKER`. A host is the financial host of the collective. When a group receives a donation, the money goes to the host's bank account. A member has access to the `app` and can pay for a transaction.
