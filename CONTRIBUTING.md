OpenCollective is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you!

# Introduction

First, thank you for considering contributing to OpenCollective! It's people like you that make OpenCollective such a great community.

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with

- **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open)
- **Documentation**: suggest edits to [our wiki](http://docs.opencollective.com/)
- **Marketing**: writing blog posts, use cases, sharing success stories.
- **Internationalization**: [translating the interface](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective-frontend/tree/master/src/lang)
- **Design**: many collectives don't have a logo or a background image for their hero. Create an issue for it and submit your proposal. We always give credit where credit is due.
- **Code**: there are plenty of [open issues](https://github.com/OpenCollective/OpenCollective/issues). Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to OpenCollective? You can start by looking through the
[good first issues](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

# Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.

# Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.

If it's a bug fix, it will probably be quickly merged and deployed. If it's a new feature, we will probably ask to limit it to your own collective as a start to see how it goes before releasing it to all other collectives.
