# Community Guidelines

We are a community based on trust, transparency and contribution. We have a trust by default policy and in order to keep it that way, we expect everyone to follow these community guidelines and act accordingly. 

**Be honest.** Be honest about who you are, what your collective is doing, why you are fundraising and what you want to do with those funds. Dishonesty is not only damaging to you but to all other collectives. Don’t be the one bringing mistrust into this community. 

**The collective first.** Collectives are groups of people with a shared mission. People may come and go, but the mission remains. A successful collective is a collective that survives its initial founders.

**Be inclusive.** The reason why we can do great things together, is because each of us brings a different perspective. Whoever you are, you have a unique perspective and unique skills that you can contribute to a collective.

**Be respectful.** For everyone to be able to feel welcome to contribute, it's important to create a safe space. Be respectful of everyone's point of view. Don't make ad hominem attacks. Be also respectful of other's people time.

**Be mindful.** Your backers will definitely want to hear about how you are going, get invitations to your activities, and stay connected. Please be respectful of their inboxes and their time and make sure they are always wanting more! 

**If something’s wrong, let us know.** We believe in self-managing systems so we don’t police or moderate, the only way of making this work is if we share the effort of ensuring that everything is as it should be. If you see something wrong, off, or that looks funny to you, let us know info@opencollective.com 

**Share the love.** If you like something, share it with your friends, let the world know and receive some love in return. 

As the OpenCollective community grows, we may have to redesign these guidelines and the way we enforce them. It’s up to all of us to build an honest, safe and trustworthy community. Thank you for making it real.
