  <summary>Triage Template (team only)</summary>

  This template is for members of the team to triage for prioritisation. For more guidance see https://www.loom.com/share/369ab467fbc64dec848085d38ff57ca0:

  P1 high frequency, high impact
  P2 low frequency, high impact
  P3 high frequency, low impact
  P4 low frequency, low impact

  Examples of high impact - a problem affects users during an essential process (expenses and payments > onboarding and registration > contributing) with no workaround.

  High frequency - >10% of users affected (measured as a proportion of total potential users for this case).
