<!-- There are _many_ different frameworks for describing problems and ideas, feel free to use a framework you are already used to, otherwise use the following prompts to guide you-->

## Who is your user?
<!-- describe the broad class of user rather than an individual i.e. contributors to multiple collectives-->

## What are they trying to achieve?
<!-- try not to describe a solution, try to describe what they are _ultimately_ trying to achieve i.e. file a tax return. Feel free to use the following as a template.-->

_When <situation>, I want to <motivation>, so I can <outcome>_

## How are they currently doing this?
<!-- problems with workarounds already followed are likely to have a greater need for the individual. -->

  <summary>Triage Template (core team only)</summary>

  This template is for members of the team to triage for prioritisation. For more guidance see https://www.loom.com/share/369ab467fbc64dec848085d38ff57ca0:

  P1 high frequency, high impact
  P2 low frequency, high impact
  P3 high frequency, low impact
  P4 low frequency, low impact

  Examples of high impact - a problem affects users during an essential process (expenses and payments > onboarding and registration > contributing) with no workaround.

  High frequency - >10% of users affected (measured as a proportion of total potential users for this case).
